# DeLorean Goodies

These are not my creation, but a generous contribution by community member Brandon Fayette (https://www.facebook.com/brandon.fayette):

Hey all,
I'm releasing the tail light design into the wild for you all to do what you will with them.  This design was built for a custom led board but I've added pressure clips that hold and mount original taillight boards to the system.  I DO have a version that is a recreation of the original taillight buckets and reflector but its not very cost effective to use in this scenario.
I've also made the angles of the inner tail light board clips angled so that you can add reflector material (or tape) to them in order to have the lights be D.O.T. style protected with far more than just the center red light being a reflector section.
Each lens is a unique part which can be replaced independently if damaged.
The frame is pressure clipped and extra reinforced by the six screw holes that mount the taillights to the car.
There is a channel for weatherstripping that you can run along the inner frame to keep the dust and moisture out as well!
The videos show the original taillight on the left and the clear version of the right taillight on the right.  The photos show the fully colored version of the left taillight.
You could also 3d print this and put it on your wall if you wanted.
The files are for the right Taillight but you can mirror it for the left.
Now that this is completed you all can make tail lights for yourself and the files are given freely away to you all under Creative Commons.  I would just LOVE to know if you make your own and if you do variations on it please keep me in the loop and I'd love to get credit if you ever sell them or produce them at least in name.  I feel like that would be a good trade for the 3 grand or so I've spent out of pocket to get these made for you all.
I'm glad I could reverse engineer this and I want to thank Chris Miles and  Tim Angers for discussions, reference, and overall being there on this journey, the Moby Dick of the Delorean.
I know a lot of you don't have 3d printers but the technology is growing cheaper every year.  Hold these files in case your originals ever get damaged, or make a set and store your originals away safely.  Do what you will, I'm just glad I could make it happen.
